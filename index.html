<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Click on the card to turn it over and see its face value. After 2 cards are selected, their ranks are compared. When a match is found, the score is increased by 1. If no match is found, the user must press the Next Turn button to turn the cards back over. Click the New Game button to shuffle the deck and start over!</p>
<h2>Why Play?</h2>
<p>This is a great game to challenge your memory and compare yourself to others. See who has the best memory!</p>
